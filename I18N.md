Localization / i18n Notes

- Externalize visible strings from `tetris.html` into a small dictionary object.
- Provide a language selector in the main menu.
- Use UTF-8 encoding (HTML should include `<meta charset="utf-8">`).
- Suggested initial locales: Thai (th), English (en)

Implementation idea:
- Keep a `strings` object and render UI text based on `navigator.language` or saved preference.
- Fallback to English when translation missing.
